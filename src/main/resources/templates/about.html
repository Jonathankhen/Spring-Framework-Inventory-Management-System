    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The Family Diner started as a small establishment with a big dream: to serve hearty, flavorful meals just like those cooked in our own home kitchen. Over the years, we’ve grown in size but our core values remain the same. We use locally sourced ingredients, traditional recipes, and a touch of love in every dish we serve.</p>

    <p>Our menu features a wide variety of dishes, all made using high-quality ingredients and seasoned with the perfect blend of spices. From our famous all-day breakfasts to our succulent dinner specials, there's something to satisfy every palate. Don't forget to try our homemade pies, baked fresh daily!</p>
